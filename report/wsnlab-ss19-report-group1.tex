% *** MISC UTILITY PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{ifpdf}
% Heiko Oberdiek's ifpdf.sty is very useful if you need conditional
% compilation based on whether the output is pdf or dvi.
% usage:
% \ifpdf
%   % pdf code
% \else
%   % dvi code
% \fi
% The latest version of ifpdf.sty can be obtained from:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/oberdiek/
% Also, note that IEEEtran.cls V1.7 and later provides a builtin
% \ifCLASSINFOpdf conditional that works the same way.
% When switching from latex to pdflatex and vice-versa, the compiler may
% have to be run twice to clear warning/error messages.






% *** CITATION PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{cite}
% cite.sty was written by Donald Arseneau
% V1.6 and later of IEEEtran pre-defines the format of the cite.sty package
% \cite{} output to follow that of IEEE. Loading the cite package will
% result in citation numbers being automatically sorted and properly
% "compressed/ranged". e.g., [1], [9], [2], [7], [5], [6] without using
% cite.sty will become [1], [2], [5]--[7], [9] using cite.sty. cite.sty's
% \cite will automatically add leading space, if needed. Use cite.sty's
% noadjust option (cite.sty V3.8 and later) if you want to turn this off.
% cite.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. Be sure and use
% version 4.0 (2003-05-27) and later if using hyperref.sty. cite.sty does
% not currently provide for hyperlinked citations.
% The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/cite/
% The documentation is contained in the cite.sty file itself.






% *** GRAPHICS RELATED PACKAGES ***
%
\ifCLASSINFOpdf
  % \usepackage[pdftex]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../pdf/}{../jpeg/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.pdf,.jpeg,.png}
\else
  % or other class option (dvipsone, dvipdf, if not using dvips). graphicx
  % will default to the driver specified in the system graphics.cfg if no
  % driver is specified.
  % \usepackage[dvips]{graphicx}
  % declare the path(s) where your graphic files are
  % \graphicspath{{../eps/}}
  % and their extensions so you won't have to specify these with
  % every instance of \includegraphics
  % \DeclareGraphicsExtensions{.eps}
\fi
% graphicx was written by David Carlisle and Sebastian Rahtz. It is
% required if you want graphics, photos, etc. graphicx.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at: 
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/graphics/
% Another good source of documentation is "Using Imported Graphics in
% LaTeX2e" by Keith Reckdahl which can be found as epslatex.ps or
% epslatex.pdf at: http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/info/
%
% latex, and pdflatex in dvi mode, support graphics in encapsulated
% postscript (.eps) format. pdflatex in pdf mode supports graphics
% in .pdf, .jpeg, .png and .mps (metapost) formats. Users should ensure
% that all non-photo figures use a vector format (.eps, .pdf, .mps) and
% not a bitmapped formats (.jpeg, .png). IEEE frowns on bitmapped formats
% which can result in "jaggedy"/blurry rendering of lines and letters as
% well as large increases in file sizes.
%
% You can find documentation about the pdfTeX application at:
% http://www.tug.org/applications/pdftex





% *** MATH PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage[cmex10]{amsmath}
% A popular package from the American Mathematical Society that provides
% many useful and powerful commands for dealing with mathematics. If using
% it, be sure to load this package with the cmex10 option to ensure that
% only type 1 fonts will utilized at all point sizes. Without this option,
% it is possible that some math symbols, particularly those within
% footnotes, will be rendered in bitmap form which will result in a
% document that can not be IEEE Xplore compliant!
%
% Also, note that the amsmath package sets \interdisplaylinepenalty to 10000
% thus preventing page breaks from occurring within multiline equations. Use:
%\interdisplaylinepenalty=2500
% after loading amsmath to restore such page breaks as IEEEtran.cls normally
% does. amsmath.sty is already installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/amslatex/math/





% *** SPECIALIZED LIST PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{algorithmic}
% algorithmic.sty was written by Peter Williams and Rogerio Brito.
% This package provides an algorithmic environment fo describing algorithms.
% You can use the algorithmic environment in-text or within a figure
% environment to provide for a floating algorithm. Do NOT use the algorithm
% floating environment provided by algorithm.sty (by the same authors) or
% algorithm2e.sty (by Christophe Fiorio) as IEEE does not use dedicated
% algorithm float types and packages that provide these will not provide
% correct IEEE style captions. The latest version and documentation of
% algorithmic.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithms/
% There is also a support site at:
% http://algorithms.berlios.de/index.html
% Also of interest may be the (relatively newer and more customizable)
% algorithmicx.sty package by Szasz Janos:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/algorithmicx/




% *** ALIGNMENT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{array}
% Frank Mittelbach's and David Carlisle's array.sty patches and improves
% the standard LaTeX2e array and tabular environments to provide better
% appearance and additional user controls. As the default LaTeX2e table
% generation code is lacking to the point of almost being broken with
% respect to the quality of the end results, all users are strongly
% advised to use an enhanced (at the very least that provided by array.sty)
% set of table tools. array.sty is already installed on most systems. The
% latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/required/tools/


%\usepackage{mdwmath}
%\usepackage{mdwtab}
% Also highly recommended is Mark Wooding's extremely powerful MDW tools,
% especially mdwmath.sty and mdwtab.sty which are used to format equations
% and tables, respectively. The MDWtools set is already installed on most
% LaTeX systems. The lastest version and documentation is available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/mdwtools/


% IEEEtran contains the IEEEeqnarray family of commands that can be used to
% generate multiline equations as well as matrices, tables, etc., of high
% quality.


%\usepackage{eqparbox}
% Also of notable interest is Scott Pakin's eqparbox package for creating
% (automatically sized) equal width boxes - aka "natural width parboxes".
% Available at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/eqparbox/





% *** SUBFIGURE PACKAGES ***
%\usepackage[tight,footnotesize]{subfigure}
% subfigure.sty was written by Steven Douglas Cochran. This package makes it
% easy to put subfigures in your figures. e.g., "Figure 1a and 1b". For IEEE
% work, it is a good idea to load it with the tight package option to reduce
% the amount of white space around the subfigures. subfigure.sty is already
% installed on most LaTeX systems. The latest version and documentation can
% be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/obsolete/macros/latex/contrib/subfigure/
% subfigure.sty has been superceeded by subfig.sty.



%\usepackage[caption=false]{caption}
\usepackage[font=footnotesize]{subfig}
% subfig.sty, also written by Steven Douglas Cochran, is the modern
% replacement for subfigure.sty. However, subfig.sty requires and
% automatically loads Axel Sommerfeldt's caption.sty which will override
% IEEEtran.cls handling of captions and this will result in nonIEEE style
% figure/table captions. To prevent this problem, be sure and preload
% caption.sty with its "caption=false" package option. This is will preserve
% IEEEtran.cls handing of captions. Version 1.3 (2005/06/28) and later 
% (recommended due to many improvements over 1.2) of subfig.sty supports
% the caption=false option directly:
%\usepackage[caption=false,font=footnotesize]{subfig}
%
% The latest version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/subfig/
% The latest version and documentation of caption.sty can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/caption/




% *** FLOAT PACKAGES ***
%
\usepackage{fixltx2e}
% fixltx2e, the successor to the earlier fix2col.sty, was written by
% Frank Mittelbach and David Carlisle. This package corrects a few problems
% in the LaTeX2e kernel, the most notable of which is that in current
% LaTeX2e releases, the ordering of single and double column floats is not
% guaranteed to be preserved. Thus, an unpatched LaTeX2e can allow a
% single column figure to be placed prior to an earlier double column
% figure. The latest version and documentation can be found at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/base/



\usepackage{stfloats}
% stfloats.sty was written by Sigitas Tolusis. This package gives LaTeX2e
% the ability to do double column floats at the bottom of the page as well
% as the top. (e.g., "\begin{figure*}[!b]" is not normally possible in
% LaTeX2e). It also provides a command:
%\fnbelowfloat
% to enable the placement of footnotes below bottom floats (the standard
% LaTeX2e kernel puts them above bottom floats). This is an invasive package
% which rewrites many portions of the LaTeX2e float routines. It may not work
% with other packages that modify the LaTeX2e float routines. The latest
% version and documentation can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/sttools/
% Documentation is contained in the stfloats.sty comments as well as in the
% presfull.pdf file. Do not use the stfloats baselinefloat ability as IEEE
% does not allow \baselineskip to stretch. Authors submitting work to the
% IEEE should note that IEEE rarely uses double column equations and
% that authors should try to avoid such use. Do not be tempted to use the
% cuted.sty or midfloat.sty packages (also by Sigitas Tolusis) as IEEE does
% not format its papers in such ways.





% *** PDF, URL AND HYPERLINK PACKAGES ***
%
%\usepackage{url}
% url.sty was written by Donald Arseneau. It provides better support for
% handling and breaking URLs. url.sty is already installed on most LaTeX
% systems. The latest version can be obtained at:
% http://www.ctan.org/tex-archive/macros/latex/contrib/misc/
% Read the url.sty source comments for usage information. Basically,
% \url{my_url_here}.





% *** Do not adjust lengths that control margins, column widths, etc. ***
% *** Do not use packages that alter fonts (such as pslatex).         ***
% There should be no need to do such things with IEEEtran.cls V1.6 and later.
% (Unless specifically asked to do so by the journal or conference you plan
% to submit to, of course. )

%\boldmath
    The source of future energy production has to be and is undoubtedly renewable and environmentally friendly. Solar power is one of the most readily available energy sources in almost all parts of the world. Although solar power is ubiquitous, certain physical and technological limitations allow for a maximum efficiency factor of 37\% (and thats for commercially avaiable high end solar cells). This implies that only 37\% of the sun's energy that is captured by the solar cell can be converted to useful electrical energy. This paper focuses on using Wireless Sensor Networks (WSN) to utilise the maximum possible energy of the solar cells without any further losses by aligning the solar panel orthogonal to the sunrays depending on the daytime.
\end{abstract}
% IEEEtran.cls defaults to using nonbold math in the Abstract.
% This preserves the distinction between vectors and scalars. However,
% if the conference you are submitting to favors bold math in the abstract,
% then you can use LaTeX's standard command \boldmath at the very start
% of the abstract to achieve this. Many IEEE journals/conferences frown on
% math in the abstract anyway.

\section{Introduction}
% no \IEEEPARstart

The energy generated by the solar panels is highly dependent on the angle of incidence of the sunrays on the panel.

\begin{figure}[htbp]
	\includegraphics[width=2.5in]{img/SunsPath1.png}
	\centering
    \captionsetup{justification=centering}
	\caption{Suns path in Winter and Summer. Source: \cite{b1}}
	\label{fig:SunsPath1}
\end{figure}

The sun's path in the horizon is dynamic and dependent on the time of the year. In the northern hemisphere, the sun is higher in the sky during summer and lower in the winter. In the summer the sun rises in the north east and sets in the north west. Whereas in winter, the sun rises in the south east and sets in the south west as it can be seen in Fig.~\ref{fig:SunsPath1}

\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=2.5in]{img/SunsPath2.png}

    \captionsetup{justification=centering}
    \caption{Angle of incidence of the suns rays on the panel Source: \cite{b2}}
    \label{fig:SunsPath2}
\end{figure}

\par\smallskip
As we can see from Fig. ~\ref{fig:SunsPath2}, consequent of the sun's path in the sky the angle of incidence of the sun's rays on the panel changes not only during the day but as well as during the different months of the year.

\par\smallskip
In order to track the sun's rays, so that the solar panel is always perpendicular to it, we need a dynamic system that adjusts to the E-W changes in the suns angle during the different times of the day as well the N-S tracking during the changes in the months.

\section{Application Set up}

For our application of using a wireless sensor network for solar tracking, we employ three different kinds of sensors, eight wireless motes, of which one mote is set up as the base station connected to a desktop computer and seven motes are deployed around the basestation to function as sensor and panel control motes.\\
Since only four digital servo motors are available, not every mote in the field is able to align the solar panel according to the sun's rays, but can still measure and transmit sensor values. A possible setup with a multihop communication towards the base station is depicted in Fig~\ref{fig:ApplicationSetup}. 


\begin{figure}[htbp]
    \includegraphics[width=3in]{img/Application_Setup.png}

    \captionsetup{justification=centering}
    \caption{Possible application setup with seven sensor motes and a base station ensuring multihop communication.}
    \label{fig:ApplicationSetup}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Sensors}
Described below are the different types of sensors used in our application along and their uses:

\begin{itemize}
    \item Digital Servo Motor - HS-422\cite{servoMotor}\newline
        A servo motor is a cheap rotary actuator which is connected to the mote via three wires: Ground (GND), Voltage (VDD) and Signal. The servo angle can be set via the signal wire by using a PWM-Signal. Most servos expect to see a pulse every 20ms. The correspondence between pulsewidth and servo angle is as in formula The servos will be used to change the angle of solar panels.
\begin{equation}\label{eq:Servo_PWM}
pw = 1.0ms + 1.0ms \cdot (\frac{\alpha}{\alpha_{max}})
\end{equation}
    \item Light Sensors\cite{LightSensor}\newline
        The light sensors are used in this proof of concept to simulate the power output of the solar panel.
    \item Wind Speed Sensor\cite{WindSensor}\newline
        This monitors the windspeed at all times and is connected directly to the base station. In the case of excessive wind speeds, the panels will have to be stowed at a safe angle.
    \item Zolertia RE-mote platform\cite{REmote}\newline
        This is the brain of the Wireless sensor network which will be used together with the Contiki OS

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Motes}
We are using 8 motes in total out of which
\begin{itemize}
    \item 7x Zolertia REmotes are used as nodes attached to solar panels
    \item 1x Zolertia REmote is used as a base station
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Base station}
    The base station is connected to a computer which displays the GUI (current state of the network). It runs a different code compared to the panel motes as it has to account for interfacing with the computer and collect data from the wind speed sensor at the same time.
\subsubsection{Panel Motes}
    The panel Motes runs a subset of the base station code.

\section{Network description and Routing Techniques}
In this proof of concept we are demonstating an energy harvesting WSN which provides information on the status of the solar panel along with the ability to control the angle of the panel in 1 axis. In a real world scenario it is intended that the mote\cite{REmote} will be connected to the solar panel and be able to draw minimal power required for the functioning of the mote.
\subsection{Network}
Considering our application and the reliability as one of the factors, we decided that a centralised base station polling based quering scheme suits our application the most. The routes are first discovered during the network discovery phase and the routing tables are exchanged as described in \ref{NetDisc}

\subsection{Modes of Operation}
In our application we have 5 modes of operation, which are 
\begin{itemize}
    \item IDLE
    \item NETWORKDISCOVERY
    \item PATHMODE
    \item UNICASTMODE
    \item EMERGENCY
\end{itemize}


\subsubsection{IDLE} \label{IDLEMODE}
When the device comes out of reset this is mode, the mote gets into.

    \label{fig:StateMachine}
\end{figure}

\subsection{Routes}

\subsection{Network Discovery} \label{NetDisc}

\section{Graphical User Interface (GUI)}
The graphical user interface (GUI) is a desktop application programmed with the aid of the QT Creator and focuses on displaying information about the motes operating in the field and allows the user to interact with a desired mote .The computer running the GUI is directly connected to the base station mote via a serial link.\\
The GUI basically consists of the two tabs "General" and "Connections" as shown in Fig.~\ref{GUI_general} and Fig.~\ref{GUI_connections}.\\
The "General" tab shows a network graph of the wireless sensor network and the system time. Communicating sensor motes are depicted with a yellow circle and a number inside, whereas the base station is shown centered as green circle. The doublesided arrows depict the wireless communication route and therefore the network topology. It does not show possible wireless communication between sensor motes, because only the shortest paths towards the base station as sink in the network is of importance.
The two buttons "Network Discovery" and "Emergency" in the bottom left corner enable the user to trigger these two operational states manually.\\
Two info boxes aligned to the right side of the window show the sensor information of the motes. The upper info box shows the values of the anemometer connected to the base station, such as the actual wind speed, the average windspeed, the maximum windspeed and the emergency threshold, at which the solar panels are aligned to a predefined safety angle. The GUI also allows to choose a user defined emergency threshold, which is set by pressing the "Set" button next to the number field. The default value is 16 km/h.\\
The lower info box shows the sensor information of the selected mote. A mote is selected by clicking on a mote in the network graph. The particular information such as the Node ID, the temperature, voltage, luminosity and panel angle are presented. For maintenance reasons it is also possible to operate the selected mote by clicking on the "Manual" button. It is then possible to enter an angle between 0 and 180 degrees to manually align the selected solar panel by clicking the "Set" button next to the number field.\\
The second tab of the GUI allows the user to connect and disconnect the serial link to the base station via selecting the respective port and clicking the buttons "Open" to connect or "Close" to disconnect. The textbox aligned to the bottom of the tab shows possible debug information from the base station.

% An example of a floating figure using the graphicx package.
% Note that \label must occur AFTER (or within) \caption.
% For figures, \caption should occur after the \includegraphics.
% Note that IEEEtran v1.7 and later has special internal code that
% is designed to preserve the operation of \label within \caption
% even when the captionsoff option is in effect. However, because
% of issues like this, it may be the safest practice to put all your
% \label just after \caption rather than within \caption{}.
%
% Reminder: the "draftcls" or "draftclsnofoot", not "draft", class

\section{Conclusion}
The power efficiency of solar panels highly depends on the inclanation angle of the sunrays. By aligning the solar panel orthogonally to the sunrays depending on the daytime it is possible to increase its energy efficiency. In this application a wireless sensor network has been employd to control the solar panel angle via a digital servo and measure amount of light hitting the panel with a light sensor. Furthermore the temperature of the controlling mote and its battery voltage is read out.\\
The application setup consists of seven sensor motes, of which four motes operate a digital servo. One mote functions as base station and delivers the sensor information to a desktop application with a GUI.\\
The network is set up by first initialising a network discovery routine. All motes broadcast and collect information about their neighbors to set up their very own distance vector table. After completion, the base station reaches out to each mote with a unicast request to collect the shortest path through their respective acknowledge.\\
With this information the base station is able to poll the sensor informations of each node by cycling through the network.\\
The network graph and sensor information are visually presented in the graphical user interface, which also allows to operate the servo position manually, set a wind speed emergency threshold or simply trigger an emergency case manually. It is also possible to manually restart the network discovery.\\
Further ideas to advance the application are a sun tracking algorithm which steers the solar panel according to sensor values. Another useful feature would be to integrate data visualization of the sensor values as a graph showing the history of e.g. the last 24 hours.

The conclusion goes here.\cite{dunkels2011contikimac}

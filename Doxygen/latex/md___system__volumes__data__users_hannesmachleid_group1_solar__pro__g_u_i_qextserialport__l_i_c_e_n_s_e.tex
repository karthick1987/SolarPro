\subsection*{Why license needed?}

Many users complains that, without a proper licence they can not use this library.

\DoxyCodeLine{Hi, }
\DoxyCodeLine{we are considering using a modified version of QExtSerialPort in one of our }
\DoxyCodeLine{projects (Qt Creator, http://qt.gitorious.org/qt-creator). }
\DoxyCodeLine{Would it be possible to add license header information or a license file to the   }
\DoxyCodeLine{QExtSerialPort code base? - This would make re-use of the code base easier. }
\DoxyCodeLine{If that is not  possible, could we redistribute the source code with BSD- }
\DoxyCodeLine{license headers manually added? }
\end{DoxyCode}


And


\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{I am also considering packaging the software for Debian, but I }
\DoxyCodeLine{couldn't do it yet just because of the license. }

Questions\+: 
\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{Can I use qextserialport in a commercial product?}
\DoxyCodeLine{If yes, how?}
\DoxyCodeLine{Compile it in? I guess no.}
\DoxyCodeLine{If I can use it as a library, how should the README be formulated?}
\DoxyCodeLine{Is the "MIT license" from 2008 appropriate?}

\subsection*{Why can we use M\+IT?}

\begin{DoxyCode}{0}
\DoxyCodeLine{the code is in the public domain. Do whatever you like with it. Right }
\DoxyCodeLine{now I have too many other things to do to put any serious time into}
\DoxyCodeLine{fixing it.  Trolltech should be aware of this already; they asked }
\DoxyCodeLine{about a license when they offered to host the tarball.}

\DoxyCodeLine{Hello,}
\DoxyCodeLine{My project registration at !SourceForge have been approved.}
\DoxyCodeLine{http://www.sf.net/projects/qextserialport}
\DoxyCodeLine{I thought an initial licence of Public Domain would be best solution.}
\DoxyCodeLine{Someone wrote: - Because its public domain, some could fork it under different licenses -}

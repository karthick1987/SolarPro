My hommie Johannes Machleid aka Hannes and Karthik Sukumar aka Kay (myself) worked on a prototype of a Wireless Sensor Network used for solar panel tracking.

This included a successful live demo and presentation to a panel.

The Softwares/Middlewares that were used were:
Contiki OS for WSN
QT Creator for the GUI w/ qextserialport which needs to be installed
